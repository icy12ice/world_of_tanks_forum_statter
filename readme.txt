I guess I should write a readme for this. I basically wrote this short script after getting tired of people not posting their external stats on the recruiting forum, so this crops the part that I find relevant from the wotlab's forum signature and sticks it under their forum name, replacing their forum post count, because I don't care about that.

There are only slight changes between the tampermonkey and greasemonkey versions, basically in the way it recognizes which pages to run on. If you just add the tampermonkey script to Chrome, should just work, but you'll need to set your websites to run the script on in greasemonkey (which you can pretty much just copy and paste from the @match in the tampermonkey script.
